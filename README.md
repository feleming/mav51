Heya! I am a Penetration Tester with a passion for identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in networks, systems, and infrastructures. I have extensive experience in Complex Network Penetration Testing and cloud incident response. As a Red-Teamer, I provide an adversarial perspective by challenging the assumptions made by an organisation and defenders.  Assumptions such as "we're secure because we patch"; "only X number of people can access that system"; and "technology Y would stop that" are dangerous and often don't stand up to scrutiny.  By challenging these assumptions, I can identify areas for improvement in an organizations operational defense.
